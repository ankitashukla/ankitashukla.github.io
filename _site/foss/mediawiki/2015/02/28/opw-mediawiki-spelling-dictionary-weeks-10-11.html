<p>Hello! :)</p>
<p>Since the basic prototype has already been made, therefore I am now working towards improving further features. My main focus these days is the use and integration of Ajax and ULS to improve performance and user-experience.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>In these two weeks, I learnt more about ajax and its implementation. I also studied about implementing ajax function calls without creating any extra unnecessary (intermediate) files for the purpose of function calls and execution.</p>
<p>Under the regular routine discussions with my mentor regarding the project, we talked about the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>various possibilities on the final stage advancements of the project</li>
<li>recent code bugs like:
<ul>
<li>form submit callback error throw (although the callback is already included)</li>
<li>Mediawiki coding convention with respect to ajax function call like
<ul>
<li>where  should the function be defined</li>
<li>where should it be called etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from the above mentioned activities, I also tried debugging the code for the 'Delete' ajax function call that I had already written. However, it still needs some more efforts as it is not working satisfactorily.</p>
<p>Presently, I am working towards the final effects to give the project a complete look. Will update about it soon! :)</p>
