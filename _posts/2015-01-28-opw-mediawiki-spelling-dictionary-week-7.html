<p>Hello folks! :)</p>
<p>This week was of great importance as it was the last week before the mid-term evaluations, thus marking mid-way milestone of the project! :)</p>
<p>One very important task was to provide the option of importing and exporting to the admin. Therefore, I started this week by including page import/export options for admin on his dashboard.</p>
<p><!--more-->I added a new section for import/export of spellings-list. In order to maintain consistency within the project and the coding conventions of MediaWiki, I utilized the special pages defined in Special Page Factory for importing and exporting.  I wrote a function to return such pre-defined special pages as admin page section's items.</p>
<p>By clicking on either of import or export, the admin will be able to perform the standard activities of being able to directly import or export any page to/from the project. Each link opens up a new page for performing the desired task.</p>
<p>Apart from this, I changed the code used for displaying spellings to show them in form of columns of spelling and language rather than statements.</p>
<p>The main focus of the upcoming weeks will now be working on the UI, improving the method to take user input (using ULS), improving user experience etc.</p>
<p>Tiil then, happy coding! :D</p>
